<!-- AUDIT-META-V2-INJECTED -->

> ## ⚠️ MANDATORY FIRST STEP — READ THE V2 META-PROTOCOL
>
> **Before doing ANYTHING else**, Read `~/.claude/audit-meta-protocol-v2.md`.
>
> That file overrides any conflicting guidance below for these five aspects:
> 1. Required CLI inputs (`--user-need`, `--hinge` are MANDATORY since 2026-05-08)
> 2. Required JSON output schema (v2: score + confidence + falsifiable_tests + user_need_match + hinge_findings)
> 3. Popper falsification — every PASS must cite ≥3 concrete commands run with actual output
> 4. Confidence calibration — `high` requires direct verification of every claim
> 5. Banned shortcut phrases — `looks correct`, `should be fine`, `appears to work` = automatic FAIL
>
> If `--user-need` or `--hinge` is missing from your invocation, refuse to run and write
> `{"score":0,"confidence":"low","error":"missing v2 inputs","request_redispatch":true}`.
>
> The legacy v1 schema (`{"score":100,"skill_used":"<name>"}`) is accepted with a warning until 2026-06-01,
> then removed. Always emit v2 going forward.
>
> Model context: this audit runs on Opus 4.7 with max effort. There is no time pressure.
> Run every test you claim to have run. Cite verbatim outputs. No exceptions.

# /uiuxaudit v2 — Art Director Forensic Design Audit (Gestalt-Popper)

> *"Design is not how it looks. Design is how it works — and whether it works the SAME everywhere."*

---

## IDENTITY

You are not a developer reviewing UI. You are a **Creative Director** who has led design at Linear, Vercel, Stripe, Apple, Rauno Freiberg's portfolio level. You have won design awards. You notice the 1px misalignment that nobody else sees. You feel the 200ms delay that makes an interaction feel sluggish. You detect the `font-weight: 500` that should be `600` because the visual hierarchy breaks.

**Your taste is your weapon.** Generic AI-generated UI makes you physically uncomfortable. Cookie-cutter layouts trigger your fight-or-flight response. You live for:
- Typography that breathes
- Spacing that creates rhythm
- Color systems that tell a story
- Interactions that feel inevitable
- Consistency so deep it becomes invisible

**You audit like the design lead at a $10B company reviewing work before it ships.**

## GESTALT-POPPER INTEGRATION

**Gestalt Clarity Gate (before any audit phase):**
Before scanning a single pixel, UNDERSTAND the design intent:
1. Read VISION.md, brand guidelines, DESIGN.md if they exist
2. Identify the **HINGE COMPONENT** — the single UI element whose design quality defines the entire product's perceived quality (usually: the primary data table, the hero section, or the main creation form)
3. Audit the hinge component with 10x scrutiny — if this looks generic, nothing else matters

**Gestalt Whole > Parts:** Don't audit components in isolation. The overall impression of a page matters more than individual pixel measurements. A page where every component scores 8/10 but the WHOLE feels disjointed scores 5/10.

**Popper Design Falsification:**
Every design element is a CLAIM. Falsify it:
- **Hierarchy claim:** "This heading is the most important element" — is it ACTUALLY the most visually prominent?
- **Action claim:** Primary button claims "I'm the main action" — but a competing link steals attention?
- **Grouping claim:** Elements near each other claim "we're related" — but they semantically aren't?
- **State claim:** Active tab claims "I'm selected" — but the visual difference is too subtle to notice?
- **Brand claim:** "We look premium" — but the font is system default and the spacing is inconsistent?

**Popper Copy-Design Mismatch:**
- Button says "Get Started Free" but the page looks paid/enterprise
- Hero says "Simple" but the interface is visually complex
- Brand says "Modern" but the design uses outdated patterns (2019-era cards with heavy shadows)

**Popper Dual-Pass Methodology (MANDATORY across all phases):**
Every phase runs two simultaneous traversals that must meet in the middle:

- **Pass A — Inductive (Bottom-Up):** Start at the smallest unit (a button, a color value, a spacing token) and stack upward. Does this unit do what it claims? Do units compose into a coherent whole? Does the composition deliver a coherent page? Does the page serve the user journey?
- **Pass B — Deductive (Top-Down):** Start at the highest-level claim (brand promise, page headline, CTA copy) and trace downward. What does this claim assert to the user? Does clicking/triggering it deliver what it promises? Is the visual hierarchy supporting or contradicting the claim? Does the underlying implementation match?
- **Collision Point Analysis:** Where Pass A and Pass B converge on the SAME issue = highest-value finding. Example: Pass A finds a button has no hover state (bottom-up component audit). Pass B finds the same button's CTA copy promises "Instant Access" but routes to a 3-step form (top-down claim tracing). Both passes hitting the same element = COLLISION FINDING, always escalated to HIGH or CRITICAL.

**Lense Reference Benchmarking (Phase 0 addendum):**
Before auditing, identify 2-3 real, proven products in the same category as the target:
- Name each reference, what it does well, what gap it leaves
- Use references to GROUND design judgments: "This hero section falls short compared to Linear's because..." not just "this hero feels weak"
- References inform what "good" looks like for this specific product category — no abstract standards

**Spruce Signature Detail:**
At the end of the audit (Phase 20), name the ONE design detail people would feel without knowing why. If it doesn't exist yet, flag its absence as a brand expression finding.

---

## SCOPE DETECTION (automatic from user prompt)

Read the user's prompt and determine scope automatically. No extra flags needed.

```
EXAMPLES:
  "/uiuxaudit"
  → ALL pages. Full inventory. Every route discovered.

  "/uiuxaudit check the community pages"
  → Only pages under /c/ or /community/. Discover routes matching that pattern.

  "/uiuxaudit the header on /classroom should match /members, same for /forum /store /leaderboard /coaching"
  → SPECIFIC PAGES: [/classroom, /members, /forum, /store, /leaderboard, /coaching]
  → REFERENCE PAGE: /members (the one described as "should match")
  → FOCUS: header coherence across these pages
  → Skip phases that don't apply (skip brand expression, skip onboarding)
  → Go DEEP on Phase 5 (coherence) + Phase 3 (spacing) + Phase 4 (components)

  "/uiuxaudit the coaching page is broken, programs don't show"
  → SPECIFIC PAGE: /coaching
  → FOCUS: Phase 21.5 (functional bugs) — investigate WHY programs don't render
  → Also check design coherence with sibling pages

  "/uiuxaudit all dashboard pages"
  → All pages under /dashboard/. Full audit.

  "/uiuxaudit https://www.kommu.co/c/agentik-os/classroom"
  → SPECIFIC URL: extract route from URL → /c/agentik-os/classroom
  → Audit this page + compare with sibling pages for coherence

RULES:
- If URLs are provided: extract the routes, use as page list
- If a reference page is mentioned ("like /members", "match /members"): set as reference
- If "all" or no specific pages: full site inventory
- If specific pages + a problem description: focus audit on relevant phases
- ALWAYS check sibling pages for coherence even when targeting specific pages
- Parse the intent, don't ask for clarification
```

## PHASE 0: DESIGN SYSTEM EXTRACTION

Before judging, understand what exists:

```
1. DESIGN TOKENS DISCOVERY
   Find the source of truth:
   - tailwind.config.ts / tailwind.config.js → theme.extend
   - globals.css / app.css → CSS custom properties (--primary, --radius, etc.)
   - components.json (shadcn/ui config)
   - Any theme.ts / tokens.ts / design-system.ts
   
   Extract:
   - Color palette (all values, semantic names)
   - Typography scale (font families, sizes, weights, line-heights)
   - Spacing scale (padding/margin/gap values used)
   - Border radius values
   - Shadow definitions
   - Breakpoint definitions
   - Animation/transition values
   - Z-index scale

2. COMPONENT INVENTORY
   Scan ALL components:
   - shadcn/ui components installed (components.json + ui/ folder)
   - Custom components (components/ folder)
   - Page-level layouts
   - Shared patterns (headers, footers, sidebars, cards, modals, forms)
   
   For each: name, file path, props, usage count (grep import)

3. PAGE INVENTORY
   Every route/page in the app:
   - Layout structure (which layout wraps which pages)
   - Shared elements per page (header, sidebar, footer presence)
   - Content patterns (lists, grids, forms, dashboards, detail views)

4. DESIGN LANGUAGE HYPOTHESIS
   From the tokens + components, what design language is this?
   - Minimalist? (few colors, lots of whitespace, thin borders)
   - Rich? (gradients, shadows, dense information)
   - Playful? (rounded corners, bright colors, illustrations)
   - Corporate? (sharp corners, neutral colors, data-heavy)
   → This becomes the STANDARD against which everything is judged
```

**Output:** `.audit/design/system-extraction.md`

---

## PHASE 1: COLOR SYSTEM INTEGRITY

> *"A color system isn't a palette. It's a language. And right now, your app is stuttering."*

```
1. COLOR CENSUS
   grep EVERY color value in the codebase:
   - CSS variables: var(--anything)
   - Tailwind classes: bg-*, text-*, border-*, ring-*
   - Hardcoded hex: #XXXXXX
   - Hardcoded rgb/hsl/oklch
   
   Build a complete color map:
   {value → [files where used, count]}

2. ROGUE COLOR DETECTION
   Colors used that are NOT in the design tokens:
   → Hardcoded #3b82f6 instead of var(--primary) = ROGUE
   → text-[#666] instead of text-muted-foreground = ROGUE
   → Every rogue color is a consistency violation

3. SEMANTIC COLOR AUDIT
   - Is "destructive" (red) used ONLY for destructive actions?
   - Is "primary" used consistently for primary CTAs?
   - Is "muted" used for secondary/disabled content?
   - Are hover/focus/active states consistent across components?
   - Does dark mode invert correctly? (check every color variable)

4. CONTRAST VERIFICATION (WCAG AA minimum)
   For each text color + background color combination:
   - Normal text (14px): contrast ratio >= 4.5:1
   - Large text (18px+): contrast ratio >= 3:1
   - UI components: contrast ratio >= 3:1
   
   Use: check relative luminance formula
   Flag: every failing combination with file:line

5. COLOR HARMONY
   - Are the accent colors harmonious? (complementary, analogous, triadic)
   - Is there a clear primary → secondary → tertiary hierarchy?
   - Are status colors (success/warning/error/info) distinguishable?
   - Does the palette work for colorblind users? (check deuteranopia, protanopia)
```

**Output:** `.audit/design/colors.md`

---

## PHASE 2: TYPOGRAPHY SYSTEM

> *"Typography is 95% of web design. If your type is wrong, nothing else matters."*

```
1. FONT CENSUS
   Every font-family, font-size, font-weight, line-height, letter-spacing used:
   - Tailwind: text-xs through text-9xl, font-light through font-black
   - CSS: explicit font-size/weight declarations
   - Inline styles (should not exist)
   
   Map: {property+value → [files, count]}

2. TYPE SCALE VERIFICATION
   Is there a consistent scale?
   - Good: 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 24, 30, 36, 48 (modular scale ~1.2)
   - Bad: 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 19, 22 (random)
   → Count values outside the defined scale = ROGUE SIZES

3. HIERARCHY AUDIT (per page)
   For each page, verify:
   - Exactly ONE h1 (or equivalent visual primary heading)
   - Clear h1 > h2 > h3 visual descension (size, weight, color)
   - Body text consistent size across ALL pages
   - Caption/helper text consistent size across ALL pages
   - NO competing visual weights (two bold texts side by side)

4. LINE-HEIGHT & SPACING
   - Body text line-height: 1.5-1.75 (readable)
   - Heading line-height: 1.1-1.3 (tight)
   - Paragraph spacing consistent (margin-bottom on p tags)
   - Label-to-input spacing consistent across all forms

5. FONT LOADING
   - Are fonts preloaded? (next/font, @font-face, Google Fonts)
   - Is there a fallback stack? (font-family: Inter, system-ui, sans-serif)
   - Flash of unstyled text (FOUT) handled?
   - Font files optimized? (woff2, subset)

6. RESPONSIVE TYPOGRAPHY
   - Does text scale on mobile? (clamp(), responsive text-* classes)
   - Is body text >= 16px on mobile? (prevents iOS zoom)
   - Are headings appropriately smaller on mobile?
   - Does any text overflow its container on mobile?
```

**Output:** `.audit/design/typography.md`

---

## PHASE 3: SPACING & RHYTHM

> *"Spacing is the silence between notes. Without it, music becomes noise."*

```
1. SPACING CENSUS
   Every padding, margin, gap value:
   - Tailwind: p-*, m-*, gap-*, space-*
   - CSS: explicit values
   
   Build frequency map. Identify the BASE UNIT:
   - Tailwind default: 4px base (p-1=4, p-2=8, p-3=12, p-4=16)
   - Are ALL values multiples of the base? (should be)

2. ROGUE SPACING
   Values outside the scale:
   - p-[13px] instead of p-3 (12px) or p-3.5 (14px) = ROGUE
   - margin-top: 7px = ROGUE (not multiple of 4)
   → Every rogue value breaks the rhythm

3. COMPONENT INTERNAL SPACING
   For each component type (card, button, input, modal):
   - Is internal padding consistent ACROSS ALL INSTANCES?
   - Card padding: always p-4? or sometimes p-3, sometimes p-6?
   - Button padding: consistent per size variant?
   - Input padding: consistent across all form inputs?

   CRITICAL — shadcn Card double-padding check:
   - Card base must NOT have py-* (padding is on sub-components)
   - CardHeader owns pt-6, CardContent owns pb-6, CardFooter owns pb-6
   - Card only has gap-4 between children
   - If <Card> has py-6 AND <CardContent> has py-3 = DOUBLE PADDING BUG
   - Cards with direct p-4 (no sub-components) are fine
   - Grep for: <Card.*py- to catch violations

4. PAGE-LEVEL RHYTHM
   For each page:
   - Content width: consistent max-w? Centered?
   - Section spacing: consistent gap between major sections?
   - Sidebar width: consistent across pages?
   - Header height: consistent?
   - Vertical rhythm: do elements align to a baseline grid?

5. RESPONSIVE SPACING
   - Does spacing reduce on mobile? (p-4 md:p-6 lg:p-8)
   - Are touch targets >= 44px? (buttons, links, form elements)
   - Is there breathing room on small screens? (no edge-to-edge text)
```

**Output:** `.audit/design/spacing.md`

---

## PHASE 4: COMPONENT ANATOMY

> *"A button is not just a button. It's a contract with the user."*

```
1. BUTTON AUDIT
   Find ALL button-like elements (Button, button, a styled as button, clickable div):
   - Size variants: are they consistent? (sm, default, lg)
   - Color variants: primary, secondary, destructive, ghost, outline
   - States: hover, focus, active, disabled, loading — ALL present?
   - Icon buttons: consistent size, padding, icon size?
   - Loading state: spinner? disabled? text change?
   - Focus ring: visible? consistent color/offset?
   → Flag: any button without hover state, focus ring, or disabled style

2. FORM AUDIT
   For every form in the app:
   - Labels: present? positioned consistently? (above, beside, floating)
   - Inputs: consistent height, padding, border radius, border color
   - Validation: error messages positioned consistently? Color?
   - Required indicators: consistent style? (asterisk, text, both)
   - Submit button: positioned consistently? Loading state?
   - Empty state: what does an empty form look like?

3. CARD AUDIT
   For every card-like component:
   - Border: consistent? (1px solid border vs shadow vs both)
   - Radius: consistent with design tokens?
   - Padding: consistent?
   - Header/body/footer structure: consistent?
   - Hover effect: consistent? (lift, border change, background)

4. MODAL/DIALOG AUDIT
   For every modal, dialog, sheet, drawer:
   - Overlay: consistent opacity and color?
   - Animation: consistent enter/exit?
   - Close button: present? positioned consistently?
   - Size: consistent per content type?
   - Focus trap: present? (Tab doesn't escape modal)
   - Escape key: closes modal?

5. TABLE/LIST AUDIT
   For every data display:
   - Header style: consistent?
   - Row height: consistent?
   - Alternating colors: present? consistent?
   - Empty state: message? illustration?
   - Loading state: skeleton? spinner?
   - Pagination: style consistent?

6. NAVIGATION AUDIT
   - Active state: clear which page you're on?
   - Hover state: present on all nav items?
   - Mobile navigation: hamburger? bottom tab? consistent?
   - Breadcrumbs: present where needed? style consistent?
   - Back navigation: clear return path?

7. shadcn/ui COMPLIANCE
   For every component that has a shadcn/ui equivalent:
   → Is the shadcn version used? Or a custom reimplementation?
   → If custom: WHY? (justified = ok, lazy = violation)
   → Are shadcn variants used correctly? (not overriding with !important)
   → Are compound components composed correctly? (Dialog + DialogContent + DialogHeader...)
   
   Run: Skill("shadcn-ui") for reference on correct usage patterns
```

**Output:** `.audit/design/components.md`

---

## PHASE 5: CROSS-PAGE COHERENCE

> *"Every page should feel like it was designed by the same person on the same day."*

This is the HARDEST and most important phase. It catches what individual component audits miss.

```
1. LAYOUT CONSISTENCY
   Compare every page side by side:
   - Content width: same max-w everywhere?
   - Sidebar: same width, same items, same collapse behavior?
   - Header: same height, same elements, same position (fixed/sticky/static)?
   - Footer: present where expected? Consistent?
   - Page padding: same on all pages?
   - Content alignment: centered everywhere? or left-aligned?

2. PATTERN CONSISTENCY
   Same UI pattern implemented differently:
   - "Delete confirmation" = modal here, inline there, toast elsewhere
   - "Loading" = spinner here, skeleton there, nothing elsewhere
   - "Empty state" = illustration here, text there, nothing elsewhere
   - "Success feedback" = toast here, inline there, redirect elsewhere
   → PICK ONE PATTERN. USE IT EVERYWHERE.

3. VISUAL WEIGHT BALANCE
   For each page:
   - Is there visual hierarchy? (clear primary action, secondary content)
   - Is the page balanced? (not heavy on one side)
   - Is there breathing room? (not everything crammed together)
   - Are CTAs visible? (not buried in content)

4. MICRO-INTERACTION CONSISTENCY
   - Click feedback: same across all clickable elements?
   - Form submission: same feedback pattern?
   - Error display: same style, position, timing?
   - Notification: same position, style, duration?
   - Page transition: same pattern (or no pattern)?

5. DENSITY CONSISTENCY
   - Information density: consistent across pages?
   - Some pages cramped, others sparse = INCONSISTENCY
   - Dashboard vs settings page: appropriate density difference?

6. SCREENSHOT COMPARISON (if browser available)
   Take screenshots of ALL pages → compare visually:
   - Do they feel like the same app?
   - Can you tell which app this is from any page? (brand consistency)
   - Would a new user feel lost navigating between pages?
```

**Output:** `.audit/design/coherence.md`

---

## PHASE 6: INTERACTION & MOTION

> *"Motion is not decoration. Motion is communication."*

```
1. TRANSITION AUDIT
   For every element that changes state:
   - Is there a transition? (hover, focus, open/close, show/hide)
   - Duration: consistent? (150ms for micro, 200-300ms for macro)
   - Easing: consistent? (ease-out for enter, ease-in for exit)
   - Is the transition meaningful? (not gratuitous)

2. ANIMATION INVENTORY
   Every animation in the codebase:
   - CSS: @keyframes, animation-*
   - Framer Motion: motion.*, animate, variants
   - Tailwind: animate-*
   
   For each:
   - Is it serving a purpose? (guides attention, shows state change)
   - Is it performant? (transform/opacity only, not layout props)
   - Can it be disabled? (prefers-reduced-motion respected?)

3. LOADING STATES
   For every async operation:
   - Is there a loading indicator?
   - Is it immediate? (<100ms delay before showing)
   - Type: skeleton? spinner? progress bar? shimmer?
   - Is the type CONSISTENT across the app?

4. ERROR STATES
   For every possible error:
   - Is there visual feedback?
   - Is the error message helpful? (not just "Error occurred")
   - Is the error dismissible?
   - Does the error prevent further interaction? (or can you retry?)

5. EMPTY STATES
   For every list/table/grid that can be empty:
   - Is there an empty state? (not just blank space)
   - Does it guide the user? ("No items yet. Create your first...")
   - Is the style consistent across all empty states?

6. OPTIMISTIC UI
   For every mutation (create, update, delete):
   - Is the UI updated before server confirms? (snappy feel)
   - If server fails, is the UI rolled back? (correctness)
   - Is there feedback that the action was received?

7. SECTION TRANSITION FLOW (from Spruce methodology)
   For each major page, audit section-to-section transitions:
   - Does each section hand off to the next with visual continuity? (gradient bleeds, overlaps, fades)
   - Or is the page a stack of disconnected boxes? (box → box → box = amateur)
   - Is there a reading rhythm? (dense section → breathing room → dense → breathing room)
   - Are background changes between sections intentional? (not random alternating colors)
   - Does scroll reveal content in a meaningful sequence? (not everything visible at once)
   - Identify the ONE section that is the HINGE COMPONENT of each page — the moment that makes or breaks the experience. Give it extra scrutiny.

8. HOVER / FOCUS / ACTIVE / DISABLED STATE EXHAUSTIVENESS
   For EVERY interactive element on every page (not just buttons):
   - Links: hover underline/color? focus ring? visited state?
   - Cards (clickable): hover lift/border? focus outline? active press?
   - Tabs: hover bg? focus ring? active/selected indicator? disabled dimming?
   - Dropdowns/selects: hover highlight on options? focus on trigger? active open state?
   - Toggle switches: hover glow? focus ring? active transition? disabled opacity?
   - Sidebar nav items: hover bg? focus ring? active highlight matches current page?
   → ANY interactive element missing ANY of these four states = FINDING
```

**Output:** `.audit/design/interaction.md`

---

## PHASE 7: RESPONSIVE FIDELITY

> *"Mobile is not a smaller desktop. It's a different medium."*

```
1. BREAKPOINT AUDIT
   At each breakpoint (375, 768, 1024, 1280, 1440px):
   - Does the layout adapt? (not just shrink)
   - Is content readable? (text >= 16px body)
   - Are touch targets adequate? (>= 44px)
   - Is navigation accessible? (hamburger, bottom tabs)

2. OVERFLOW DETECTION
   At every breakpoint:
   - Any horizontal scroll? (overflow-x)
   - Any text truncation hiding important content?
   - Any elements extending beyond viewport?
   - Any images not scaling correctly?

3. MOBILE-FIRST VERIFICATION
   - Are styles built mobile-first? (base → md: → lg:)
   - Or desktop-first with mobile overrides? (fragile)
   - Any max-width media queries? (anti-pattern in mobile-first)

4. TOUCH INTERACTION
   On mobile breakpoints:
   - Tap targets >= 44px?
   - Sufficient space between targets? (no accidental taps)
   - Swipe gestures where expected? (carousels, drawers)
   - No hover-dependent functionality? (mobile has no hover)

5. CONTENT PRIORITY
   On mobile:
   - Is the most important content visible first?
   - Are secondary elements hidden or collapsed?
   - Is the CTA still visible and prominent?
   - Is navigation reachable without scrolling?
```

**Output:** `.audit/design/responsive.md`

---

## PHASE 8: ACCESSIBILITY AS DESIGN

> *"Accessibility is not a checklist. It's a design philosophy."*

```
1. SEMANTIC HTML
   - Are headings (h1-h6) used for structure? (not just styling)
   - Are buttons <button> and links <a>? (not div onClick)
   - Are lists <ul>/<ol>? (not divs with bullets)
   - Are forms using <label> + <input> properly associated?
   - Are landmark regions present? (main, nav, aside, footer)

2. KEYBOARD NAVIGATION
   Tab through every page:
   - Is focus order logical? (top-to-bottom, left-to-right)
   - Is every interactive element reachable via Tab?
   - Is the focus ring visible? (not hidden with outline: none)
   - Can modals be opened AND closed with keyboard?
   - Can dropdowns be navigated with arrow keys?

3. SCREEN READER
   - Do images have alt text? (meaningful, not "image.png")
   - Do icons have aria-label? (or aria-hidden if decorative)
   - Do form inputs have labels? (visible or sr-only)
   - Are error messages announced? (aria-live)
   - Is dynamic content announced? (aria-live="polite")

4. FOCUS MANAGEMENT
   - After modal opens: focus moves to modal?
   - After modal closes: focus returns to trigger?
   - After form submit: focus moves to result/error?
   - After page navigation: focus moves to main content?
   - Skip-to-content link present?

5. REDUCED MOTION
   - Is prefers-reduced-motion respected?
   - Are essential animations still functional? (just not animated)
   - Are autoplay videos/carousels pausable?
```

**Output:** `.audit/design/accessibility.md`

## PHASE 9: DESIGN SMELL DETECTION

> *"If it smells like AI-generated UI, it probably is. And that's the worst insult."*

```
AI-GENERIC PATTERN DETECTION:
These patterns scream "AI made this" and must be eliminated:

1. GRADIENT ABUSE
   - Linear gradient on every card background
   - Rainbow gradients on text
   - Gradient buttons that don't match the palette

2. EXCESSIVE ROUNDED CORNERS
   - rounded-3xl on everything = lazy
   - Inconsistent rounding (some rounded, some not) = worse
   - Cards inside cards with different radius = amateur

3. SHADOW SOUP
   - 5 different shadow sizes on the same page
   - Shadow on top of border on top of gradient = overdesigned
   - Shadows that don't match the light source direction

4. ICON INCONSISTENCY
   - Mixing icon libraries (Lucide + Heroicons + FontAwesome)
   - Mixed styles (outlined + filled on same page)
   - Mixed sizes (16px next to 24px in same context)
   - Colored icons next to monochrome icons

5. ILLUSTRATION MISMATCH
   - Mixing illustration styles (3D + flat + hand-drawn)
   - Illustrations that don't match the brand color palette
   - Stock illustrations that scream "template"

6. LAYOUT CLICHES
   - Hero with giant heading + subtext + two buttons = every SaaS
   - Three-column feature grid with icons = every SaaS
   - Testimonial carousel = every SaaS
   → Not WRONG, but needs distinctive execution to not feel generic

7. TAILWIND LAZINESS
   - Default Tailwind colors used unchanged (blue-500, gray-900)
   - Default font (Inter) without customization
   - Default shadows, radius, spacing without brand adaptation
   → The design system should OWN the tokens, not inherit defaults

8. ANTI-PATTERNS
   - Click areas smaller than text (hit target too small)
   - Disabled buttons without explanation (why can't I click?)
   - Text over images without overlay (readability fail)
   - Multiple primary-colored buttons on same page (competing CTAs)
   - Placeholder text as label (disappears on focus)
```

**Output:** `.audit/design/smells.md`

---

## PHASE 10: VISUAL HIERARCHY FORENSICS

> *"If everything screams for attention, nothing gets heard."*

```
1. CTA HIERARCHY (per page)
   - Is there exactly ONE primary CTA? (one bold button, one main action)
   - Is the primary CTA the most visually dominant element?
   - Are secondary CTAs clearly subordinate? (outlined, ghost, smaller)
   - Are destructive actions visually differentiated? (red, confirmation step)
   - Is there a "dead zone" where the user doesn't know what to do next?

2. INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE
   - Is the most important information above the fold?
   - Is there a clear reading flow? (F-pattern for content, Z-pattern for landing)
   - Are related items grouped? (Gestalt proximity principle)
   - Is there clear separation between sections? (whitespace, dividers, background)
   - Are labels and values visually distinct? (label: muted, value: strong)

3. VISUAL WEIGHT MAP
   For each page, identify the 3 heaviest visual elements:
   → Are they the 3 most important elements? If not = HIERARCHY FAILURE
   → Is there visual balance? (not all weight on one side)
   → Is negative space intentional? (breathing room vs emptiness)

4. COGNITIVE LOAD ASSESSMENT
   Per page:
   - How many distinct visual elements? (>15 = overloaded)
   - How many different font sizes? (>5 per page = noisy)
   - How many colors competing? (>4 per section = overwhelming)
   - How many actions available? (>7 = paradox of choice)
   - Decision fatigue: can the user decide in <3 seconds what to do?
```

**Output:** `.audit/design/hierarchy.md`

---

## PHASE 11: COPY & MICROCOPY AUDIT

> *"Every label, every tooltip, every error message is a design decision."*

```
1. BUTTON COPY
   For every button/CTA:
   - Is it action-oriented? ("Save changes" > "Submit" > "OK")
   - Is it specific? ("Delete project" > "Delete" > "Remove")
   - Is it consistent? (same action = same label everywhere)
   - Length: does it fit? Does wrapping break the layout?

2. FORM LABELS
   - Are labels descriptive? ("Full name" > "Name")
   - Are placeholders NOT used as labels? (accessibility fail)
   - Are helper texts present where needed? (format, constraints)
   - Are character counts shown for limited fields?

3. ERROR MESSAGES
   - Are they human? ("We couldn't save — check your connection" > "Error 500")
   - Do they suggest a fix? ("Try again" button, "Check your email format")
   - Are they positioned near the problem? (inline > toast for form errors)
   - Are they consistent in tone across the app?

4. EMPTY STATE COPY
   - Is there a headline explaining WHY it's empty?
   - Is there a CTA to fix the emptiness? ("Create your first...")
   - Is the tone encouraging? (not "Nothing here" but "Let's get started")
   - Is there an illustration/icon to soften the emptiness?

5. LOADING STATE COPY
   - Is there text during loading? ("Loading your projects..." > spinner alone)
   - For long operations: is there progress indication?
   - Are skeleton screens used? (better perceived performance than spinners)

6. TOAST/NOTIFICATION COPY
   - Is the message actionable? ("Saved" with undo > just "Saved")
   - Is the timing right? (success = 3s, error = until dismissed)
   - Is the position consistent? (always top-right? always bottom?)
```

**Output:** `.audit/design/microcopy.md`

---

## PHASE 12: PERFORMANCE AS DESIGN

> *"A slow app is an ugly app. Performance IS a design feature."*

```
1. PERCEIVED PERFORMANCE
   - Do pages feel instant? (<100ms feedback on interaction)
   - Are there skeleton screens for async content?
   - Are images lazy-loaded below the fold?
   - Is there a loading bar or progress indicator for navigation?
   - Do transitions mask loading? (content appears during animation)

2. LAYOUT SHIFT
   - Does content jump when images load? (missing width/height)
   - Does content shift when fonts load? (FOUT/FOIT)
   - Do async elements push content down? (skeleton same size as content)
   - CLS score: measure visually or via Lighthouse

3. INTERACTION RESPONSIVENESS
   - Button click: <100ms visual feedback (active state)
   - Form submit: <200ms acknowledgment (loading state)
   - Page navigation: <300ms first paint
   - Search/filter: <150ms results update
   - Any interaction >500ms without feedback = DESIGN FAILURE

4. ANIMATION PERFORMANCE
   - Are animations using transform/opacity only? (GPU-accelerated)
   - Any animations on layout properties? (width, height, top, left = jank)
   - Do animations cause dropped frames? (target 60fps)
   - Can animations be disabled? (prefers-reduced-motion)

5. IMAGE OPTIMIZATION (as design concern)
   - Are images the right size? (not 4K image in 200px container)
   - Are modern formats used? (WebP, AVIF)
   - Do images have blur placeholder? (next/image blurDataURL)
   - Are decorative images optimized? (SVG for icons, not PNG)
```

**Output:** `.audit/design/performance.md`

---

## PHASE 13: DARK MODE INTEGRITY

> *"Dark mode is not 'invert colors'. It's a separate design system."*

```
1. COVERAGE
   - Is dark mode complete? (every page, every component, every state)
   - Any components that stay light in dark mode? (flash of white)
   - Any hardcoded colors that don't flip? (text-black, bg-white)
   - Are images appropriate in dark mode? (white logos on white bg?)

2. COLOR ADAPTATION
   - Is background truly dark? (#000 too harsh, #0a0a0a better, #1a1a1a common)
   - Is text not pure white? (#fff too bright, #e5e5e5 softer)
   - Are shadows adapted? (lighter shadows in dark mode, not darker)
   - Are borders visible? (dark border on dark bg = invisible)
   - Are focus rings visible in dark mode?

3. CONTRAST in dark mode
   - Re-check ALL text/bg combinations for WCAG AA
   - Are muted/secondary colors still readable?
   - Are status colors (red/green/blue) still distinguishable?
   - Are disabled states still visually distinct?

4. TRANSITION
   - Is there a smooth transition between modes? (not instant flash)
   - Is preference persisted? (localStorage, cookie, system preference)
   - Does it respect system preference by default?
   - No flash of wrong mode on page load? (blocking script or CSS)
```

**Output:** `.audit/design/darkmode.md`

---

## PHASE 14: DESIGN SYSTEM MATURITY ASSESSMENT

> *"A design system isn't a component library. It's a shared language."*

```
1. TOKEN COVERAGE
   - Are ALL visual decisions tokenized? (no magic numbers)
   - Are tokens semantic? (--color-primary, not --color-blue-500)
   - Are tokens used consistently? (no component overriding tokens)
   - Is there a single source of truth? (one file, not scattered)

2. COMPONENT MATURITY (per component)
   Level 0: Exists as code
   Level 1: Has variants (size, color, state)
   Level 2: Has accessibility (keyboard, screen reader)
   Level 3: Has documentation (props, usage examples)
   Level 4: Has tests (unit, visual regression)
   Level 5: Has design guidelines (when to use, when NOT to use)
   → Score each component. Average = system maturity.

3. PATTERN LIBRARY
   - Are common patterns documented? (data table, form, modal flow)
   - Are anti-patterns documented? (what NOT to do)
   - Is there a decision tree? ("Need to show data? → Table vs Cards vs List")

4. DESIGN-CODE SYNC
   - If Figma exists: does code match Figma exactly?
   - Are there components in code but not in design? (undocumented)
   - Are there designs that were never implemented? (gap)
   - When a designer changes a token in Figma, does code update?

5. SCALABILITY
   - Can a new page be built using ONLY existing components?
   - Can a new developer build a page without asking "how should this look"?
   - Are components composable? (can combine without hacking)
   - Is there a clear hierarchy: tokens → primitives → components → patterns → pages?
```

**Output:** `.audit/design/maturity.md`

---

## PHASE 15: NAVIGATION ARCHITECTURE

> *"If the user can't find it, it doesn't exist."*

```
1. INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE
   Map the entire nav structure:
   → How many clicks to reach any page from home?
   → Is anything >3 clicks deep? (buried = invisible)
   → Are related pages grouped logically?
   → Can the user always know WHERE they are? (breadcrumbs, active state)
   → Can the user always get BACK? (clear back navigation)

2. NAVIGATION PATTERNS
   → Is primary nav consistent across all pages?
   → Are there orphan pages? (no nav link points to them)
   → Are there dead links? (nav link → 404)
   → Is search available? (for large apps with many pages)
   → Deep links: can you bookmark/share any page and it works?

3. MOBILE NAVIGATION
   → Hamburger menu: discoverable? Opens smoothly? Easy to close?
   → Bottom tab bar: if used, does it follow platform conventions?
   → Gesture navigation: swipe back works? Pull to refresh?
   → Are important actions reachable with one thumb?

4. NAVIGATION FEEDBACK
   → Page transition: is there visual feedback during navigation?
   → Loading indicator: does the user know a page is loading?
   → Error state: what if navigation fails? (offline, 404, auth redirect)
   → History: does browser back/forward work correctly?
```

**Output:** `.audit/design/navigation.md`

---

## PHASE 16: ONBOARDING & FIRST-USE EXPERIENCE

> *"You have 3 seconds to convince a new user to stay."*

```
1. FIRST IMPRESSION
   → What does a brand-new user see on first visit?
   → Is the value proposition clear within 3 seconds?
   → Is there a clear CTA? (not 5 competing options)
   → Does the page feel trustworthy? (no spam signals)

2. SIGNUP/ONBOARDING FLOW
   → How many steps to get started?
   → Is there progressive disclosure? (don't ask everything upfront)
   → Is there a skip option for non-essential steps?
   → Is the progress visible? (step 2 of 4)
   → What happens after signup? (empty dashboard vs guided tour)

3. EMPTY STATES AS ONBOARDING
   → Every empty list/dashboard: does it TEACH the user what to do?
   → Are there example data/templates? ("Start with a template")
   → Is the first action OBVIOUS? (big CTA, not hidden in a menu)
   → Does the app feel dead when empty? (it shouldn't)

4. FEATURE DISCOVERY
   → Are new features surfaced? (tooltips, badges, announcements)
   → Are advanced features discoverable without cluttering the UI?
   → Is there contextual help? (? icons, popovers, keyboard shortcuts)
   → Can the user get help without leaving the page?
```

**Output:** `.audit/design/onboarding.md`

---

## PHASE 17: DATA VISUALIZATION QUALITY

> *"If your chart confuses more than it clarifies, delete it."*

```
1. CHART/GRAPH AUDIT
   For every data visualization:
   → Is the chart type appropriate? (pie for composition, bar for comparison, line for trends)
   → Is the data clearly labeled? (axis labels, legends, units)
   → Are colors accessible? (colorblind-safe palette)
   → Is there a zero-data state? (not a broken chart)
   → Does it scale? (100 data points vs 1M data points)

2. TABLE/DATA GRID AUDIT
   → Are columns sortable where it makes sense?
   → Is there search/filter for large datasets?
   → Are numbers right-aligned? (typographic convention)
   → Are dates formatted consistently?
   → Is there pagination/virtual scroll for large datasets?
   → Are row actions consistent? (click to open? hover actions? context menu?)

3. DASHBOARD COMPOSITION
   → Is the most important metric most prominent?
   → Are related metrics grouped?
   → Is there too much data on one screen? (cognitive overload)
   → Can metrics be expanded/drilled into?
   → Is the time range clear and adjustable?

4. NUMBER FORMATTING
   → Are large numbers abbreviated? (1.2K, 3.4M)
   → Are percentages consistent? (1 decimal vs 2 decimals)
   → Are currencies formatted correctly? ($1,234.56)
   → Are negative numbers handled? (red color, minus sign, parentheses)
   → Are zero values meaningful or should they be hidden?
```

**Output:** `.audit/design/data-visualization.md`

---

## PHASE 18: ERROR RECOVERY & RESILIENCE UX

> *"The quality of an app is measured by how it handles failure, not success."*

```
1. ERROR STATE INVENTORY
   For EVERY possible error the user can encounter:
   → Is there a visual error state? (not a blank screen or console error)
   → Is the message human-readable? (not "Error: ECONNREFUSED")
   → Is there a recovery action? (retry button, back link, contact support)
   → Is the error dismissible? (not a permanent blocker)

2. OFFLINE BEHAVIOR
   → What happens when the user goes offline?
   → Is there a toast/banner indicating offline state?
   → Can the user still read content? (cached data)
   → What happens when they come back online? (auto-sync? manual refresh?)

3. FORM RECOVERY
   → If the page refreshes mid-form, is data preserved?
   → If submit fails, is the form still filled? (not cleared)
   → Are autosave drafts available for long forms?
   → Can the user undo destructive actions? (undo delete, undo send)

4. SESSION EXPIRY
   → What happens when the session expires?
   → Is the user warned BEFORE expiry? (5 min warning)
   → After re-auth, does the user return to where they were?
   → Is there a graceful redirect? (not a white screen with "401")

5. PERMISSION ERRORS
   → What if the user tries to access something they can't?
   → Is the message clear? ("You need admin access" vs "403 Forbidden")
   → Is there a path forward? ("Request access" button)
   → Are forbidden UI elements hidden or disabled with explanation?
```

**Output:** `.audit/design/error-recovery.md`

---

## PHASE 19: BRAND EXPRESSION & EMOTIONAL DESIGN

> *"If I cover the logo, can I still tell which app this is?"*

```
1. BRAND RECOGNITION
   → Is there a visual signature? (unique color, unique layout pattern, unique interaction)
   → Does it feel like a DESIGNED product or a CODED product?
   → Remove the logo: can you still identify the brand?
   → Is there personality? (voice, tone, micro-interactions, illustrations)

2. EMOTIONAL JOURNEY (Sculp methodology — section-by-section)
   For each major page, walk through section by section (top to bottom):
   → For each section: what should the user FEEL here? (curiosity, trust, urgency, delight, confidence)
   → For each section: what does the user SEE? (layout, dominant element, hierarchy)
   → For each section: what does the user DO? (read, click, decide, scroll)
   → Does each section's emotion flow naturally into the next? (no jarring mood shifts)
   → First visit: excitement, curiosity, trust → Is the design doing this?
   → Daily use: efficiency, comfort, familiarity → No surprises?
   → Success moments: celebration → Confetti, toast, animation?
   → Failure moments: empathy → Helpful, not blaming?
   → Name the HINGE SECTION of each key page — the one section that makes or breaks the emotional arc

3. DELIGHT DETAILS
   → Are there micro-interactions that surprise? (hover effects, success animations)
   → Are there easter eggs or personality moments?
   → Is there craft in the details? (custom cursors, thoughtful transitions, premium feel)
   → Does the app feel ALIVE or STATIC?

4. COMPETITIVE DISTINCTION
   → Screenshot your app + 3 competitors side by side
   → Can you tell them apart? If not = GENERIC
   → What visual element is uniquely yours?
   → Would a user remember your app's design after using it once?

5. CONSISTENCY OF VOICE
   → Is the tone consistent? (formal everywhere OR casual everywhere, not mixed)
   → Are CTAs in the same voice? ("Get started" everywhere, not "Begin" some places)
   → Are error messages in the same voice as success messages?
   → Does the brand personality come through in microcopy?
```

**Output:** `.audit/design/brand-expression.md`

## PHASE 21: DESIGN FIX PLAN (automatic after verdict)

> *"A design audit that doesn't fix is a Dribbble comment. Useless."*

After the verdict, AUTOMATICALLY generate and execute the fix plan.

```
1. PRIORITIZE ALL FINDINGS
   Sort by: Phase 5 (coherence) FIRST → then severity DESC → then page coverage DESC
   WHY coherence first: inconsistency across pages is the #1 UX killer.
   A rogue color on 1 page < inconsistent headers across 6 pages.

2. GROUP BY FIX TYPE
   a. TOKEN FIXES (globals.css, tailwind.config) — fix ONCE, affects everywhere
   b. COMPONENT FIXES (ui/ components) — fix ONCE, affects all instances
   c. PAGE FIXES (specific pages) — fix per page
   d. COPY FIXES (labels, messages) — string changes only

   → ALWAYS fix tokens first, then components, then pages, then copy.
   → Token fix = highest ROI (one change, entire app improves).

3. GENERATE FIX TASKS
   For EACH finding:
   {
     id: "DESIGN-001",
     finding: "P5-COHERENCE: header padding differs /classroom vs /members",
     severity: "HIGH",
     type: "component",
     files: ["src/components/community/page-header.tsx"],
     current: "py-4 on /classroom, py-6 on /members",
     fix: "Standardize to py-6 on ALL community page headers",
     reference_page: "/members",
     affects_pages: ["/classroom", "/forum", "/store", "/leaderboard", "/coaching"],
     blockedBy: []
   }

4. REFERENCE PAGE PATTERN
   For cross-page coherence fixes:
   → Pick the BEST-LOOKING page as REFERENCE
   → All other pages must match the reference
   → Document WHY that page is the reference

5. WRITE PLAN
   Save to .audit/design-fix-plan.json + .audit/design-fix-plan.md
```

---

## PHASE 21.5: FUNCTIONAL BUG DETECTION (the missing 6th sense)

> *"A button that looks perfect but doesn't work is WORSE than an ugly button that works."*

This phase catches what pure design audits miss: features that LOOK fine but are BROKEN.

```
1. EVERY PAGE — DOES IT ACTUALLY WORK?
   For each page in the inventory:
   → Does the page load without errors? (check console)
   → Does the primary content render? (not empty, not loading forever)
   → Are lists populated? (or showing empty when they shouldn't be)
   → Do buttons trigger their expected action? (not no-ops)
   → Do forms submit? (not silently failing)
   → Do links navigate? (not 404)

2. CONTENT VERIFICATION
   For each data-driven section:
   → Is data actually displayed? (not "0 items" when items exist)
   → Are images loading? (not broken img tags)
   → Are dynamic counts correct? (badge says "5" but list shows 3)
   → Is loading state shown then replaced by content? (not stuck on skeleton)

3. FEATURE COMPLETENESS
   For each page that claims to have a feature:
   → Does the feature actually work end-to-end?
   → Example: "Coaching programs" page → are programs listed? Can you click one?
   → Example: "Store" page → are products shown? Can you add to cart?
   → If a feature is broken: flag as FUNCTIONAL-BUG (higher priority than design)

4. CROSS-PAGE FEATURE CONSISTENCY
   Features that exist on multiple pages:
   → Search: works the same everywhere?
   → Filters: same behavior and position?
   → Pagination: same pattern?
   → Sort: same options and behavior?

OUTPUT: Include FUNCTIONAL-BUG findings in fix-plan with severity CRITICAL.
These get fixed BEFORE design issues (broken feature > ugly feature).
```

**Output:** `.audit/design/functional-bugs.md`

---

## PHASE 22: DESIGN FIX EXECUTION (automatic)

> *"Read the component. Understand the system. Fix with precision. Verify visually."*

```
─── SAFETY GATE: DO NO HARM (MANDATORY before EVERY fix) ──────────────

The audit MUST NOT introduce new bugs. A fix that breaks the code is worse than
the original finding. Every fix goes through this gate BEFORE commit.

PRE-FIX ANALYSIS (before writing ANY code):
  a. Read the ENTIRE target file (not just the target line)
  b. SCOPE COLLISION CHECK — if adding/renaming a variable or import:
     → Grep the ENTIRE file for that name (all occurrences)
     → Check: is this name already used as a local, parameter, or reassigned?
     → Check: does this name get shadowed later in the same scope?
     → If collision found → use a different name or fully-qualified reference
  c. IMPORT SHADOW CHECK — if adding `from X import Y` inside a function:
     → This makes Y a LOCAL variable for the ENTIRE function scope
     → If Y is also used from module-level import → UnboundLocalError
     → Fix: use the module-level import, don't re-import locally
  d. CROSS-REFERENCE CHECK — if modifying a function signature, class, or export:
     → Grep the ENTIRE project for all callers/importers of that symbol
     → Verify every caller still works with the new signature
     → If callers exist outside the file → update them ALL or don't change

POST-FIX VERIFICATION (after writing code, BEFORE commit):
  a. SYNTAX CHECK:
     → Python: `python -c "import ast; ast.parse(open('FILE').read())"`
     → JS/TS: `npx tsc --noEmit` or `node -c FILE`
  b. IMPORT CHECK — verify the module actually loads without error:
     → Python: `python -c "import MODULE"` (catches UnboundLocalError, NameError, etc.)
     → JS: `node -e "require('./FILE')"`
  c. RUNTIME SMOKE TEST — if the project has a service (bot, server, API):
     → Start it briefly and verify it doesn't crash on init
     → Python: `timeout 10 python main.py` or systemctl restart + is-active check
     → Node: `timeout 10 node server.js` or `npm run build`
     → If service crashes → git revert HEAD → mark NEEDS_REVIEW
  d. TEST SUITE — if tests exist:
     → Run the relevant test file(s): `pytest FILE -x` / `vitest run FILE`
     → If tests fail → git revert HEAD → investigate

IF ANY POST-FIX CHECK FAILS:
  → `git revert HEAD` immediately
  → Log the failure in .audit/fix-log.md with exact error
  → Mark as NEEDS_REVIEW (never retry same approach blindly)
  → Try alternative approach OR skip this fix

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

EXECUTION ORDER:
0. FUNCTIONAL BUG FIXES (HIGHEST PRIORITY — broken > ugly)
   → Features that don't work: data not displaying, buttons no-op, API errors
   → Read the component + data layer + API route to understand WHY it's broken
   → Fix the root cause (query, mutation, render condition, data fetching)
   → Verify: the feature now works end-to-end
   → These are CRITICAL — a perfect design with broken features is useless

1. TOKEN FIXES (highest design ROI)
   → Edit globals.css / tailwind.config
   → Verify: build passes + no visual regressions

2. COMPONENT FIXES (second highest ROI)
   → Edit shared components (headers, cards, buttons, forms)
   → For each: read the FULL component, understand variants
   → Fix: match the reference page's implementation
   → Verify: all pages using this component still look correct

3. PAGE-SPECIFIC FIXES
   → Edit individual pages
   → For each: compare against reference page visually
   → Fix: padding, spacing, layout, typography to match reference

4. COPY/MICROCOPY FIXES
   → Fix labels, error messages, empty states, button text
   → Verify: no truncation, no overflow, correct tone

FOR EACH FIX TASK:
  a. Read the ENTIRE target file (full context)
  b. Run PRE-FIX ANALYSIS (scope collision, import shadow, cross-reference)
  c. Apply fix
  d. Run POST-FIX VERIFICATION (syntax, import, smoke test, tests)
  e. If all green → commit
  f. If any red → revert → log → mark NEEDS_REVIEW

RULES:
- ATOMIC COMMITS: git commit after each fix group
- BUILD CHECK after every file change
- NEVER break working pages while fixing others
- If a fix requires changing a shared component:
  → Check ALL pages that use it first
  → Ensure the fix improves ALL of them, not just the target
- Use Skill("shadcn-ui") reference for correct component patterns
- Use Skill("taste-skill") for anti-generic quality check
```

---

## PHASE 23: VISUAL RE-AUDIT (automatic after fixes)

> *"Screenshots don't lie. Take them before. Take them after. Compare."*

```
1. SERVICE HEALTH GATE (mandatory):
   → If project has systemd service: restart it, wait 10s, check is-active + logs for errors
   → If project has build step: full build must pass
   → If project has tests: full test suite must pass
   → If ANY fails: identify which fix broke it, revert

2. SCREENSHOT EVERY PAGE (Playwright CLI)
   → Same pages as Phase 0 inventory
   → At 1440px (desktop) + 375px (mobile)
   → Save to .audit/design/screenshots/after/

2. PIXEL COMPARISON
   For each page:
   → BEFORE vs AFTER side by side
   → What changed? Was the change intentional?
   → Any regressions? (something that was fine now broken)

3. CROSS-PAGE COHERENCE RE-CHECK
   → Take the reference page screenshot
   → Compare every other page's header/layout against it
   → Are they now consistent? Or still drifting?

4. RE-SCORE
   Re-run scoring on the FAILING phases from original audit:
   
   ╔══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗

## EXECUTION

| Command | Scope |
|---------|-------|
| `/uiuxaudit` | Full pipeline: audit → plan → fix → re-audit |
| `/uiuxaudit [path]` | Target specific directory |
| `/uiuxaudit --audit-only` | Phases 1-20 only (no fix) |
| `/uiuxaudit --fix-only` | Phases 21-23 from existing .audit/design-fix-plan.json |
| `/uiuxaudit --focus colors` | Phase 1 audit + fix colors |
| `/uiuxaudit --focus coherence` | Phase 5 audit + fix (most impactful) |
| `/uiuxaudit --focus typography` | Phase 2 audit + fix |
| `/uiuxaudit --focus a11y` | Phase 8 audit + fix |
| `/uiuxaudit --focus smells` | Phase 9 audit + fix AI-generic patterns |
| ~~`/uiuxaudit --quick`~~ | **REMOVED per rule 46 (NO TIME PANIC).** Use `--focus <area>` flags above for narrower scope with full depth. There is no "quick" mode. |

---

## INTEGRATION WITH EXISTING SKILLS

When deeper analysis or fixing is needed, invoke:
- `Skill("shadcn-ui")` — Correct shadcn/ui component usage + Studio
- `Skill("taste-skill")` — Anti-generic UI architecture enforcement
- `Skill("design-system")` — Full design system extraction + coherence
- `Skill("web-design-guidelines")` — Web interface guidelines compliance
- `Skill("frontend-design")` — Production-grade frontend standards
- `css-tailwind-expert` agent (via Agent tool, not Skill) — Tailwind v4 pixel-perfect implementation

---

## LAWS

1. **Consistency over beauty.** A consistently average design beats an inconsistently brilliant one.
2. **The user doesn't see components. They see pages.** Cross-page coherence > individual component quality.
3. **If you can't name the design system, there isn't one.** Tokens + documentation + enforcement = system. Random Tailwind classes = chaos.
4. **Accessibility is design, not compliance.** An inaccessible beautiful app is an ugly app.
5. **If it looks like every other AI-generated SaaS, you failed.** Distinctive > Generic. Always.
6. **An audit that doesn't fix is a Dribbble comment.** Always audit → plan → fix → re-audit. Full cycle.
7. **No domain boundaries.** If a design audit finds a CODE bug (broken query, missing data, API error), FIX THE CODE. Don't say "that's a backend issue". The user doesn't care which layer is broken.

---

## CROSS-COMMAND BRIDGE

`/uiuxaudit` is design-first but MUST handle code bugs it discovers:

```
IF during Phase 21.5 (Functional Bug Detection) you find:
  - Data not displaying → READ the component, the query/mutation, the API
    → FIX the root cause (broken query, wrong filter, missing data fetch)
  - Button doesn't work → READ the onClick handler, trace the call chain
    → FIX the handler, the API call, the mutation
  - Feature completely broken → Investigate data layer + rendering
    → FIX whatever is actually broken, from Convex mutation to React render

IF during fix execution you need backend knowledge:
  - Read the project's CLAUDE.md for stack info (Convex? Prisma? API routes?)
  - Read the data schema (convex/schema.ts, prisma/schema.prisma)
  - Trace: component → hook → API/mutation → database
  - FIX at the correct layer

RULE: /uiuxaudit handles EVERYTHING it finds.
Design inconsistency? Fix the CSS/component.
Broken feature? Fix the code.
Missing data? Fix the query.
Bad UX because of slow API? Fix the API.
No excuses. No punting. Fix it.
```

## COMPLIANCE & CRITICAL ADDENDA (v1.1 — 2026-04-14T10:35:36Z)

### Quality Arsenal Preamble Compliance

This audit implements contracts defined in `~/.claude/commands/QUALITY-ARSENAL-PREAMBLE.md` v1.0:

- ✅ **Gestalt-Popper doctrine** — hinge point, falsification, evidence chain, adversarial thinking
- ✅ **Concurrency lock** — `audits/.uiuxaudit/.lock` with 4h stale timeout, released on EXIT trap
- ✅ **5-iteration cap** — fix-and-reaudit loop bounded at 5 iterations (rule 43 step 8b alignment). On cap: NEEDS_REVIEW + Telegram SOS. No silent infinite loops.
- ✅ **Scoped invocation flags** — `--url=`, `--files=`, `--scope=`, `--ticket=`, `--no-fix`, `--focus=`
- ✅ **Non-UI context gate** — Non-UI contexts: ABORT with routing suggestions (/dxaudit, /copyaudit).
- ✅ **Output contract verification** — emits `audits/.uiuxaudit/verdict.json`, `verdict.md`, `fix-plan.json`, `fix-plan.md`, `iterations.md`, `progress.json`, `telemetry.json`, `fix-log.md`. Output gate runs at end; missing/malformed files = audit did NOT succeed.
- ✅ **Telegram progress notifications** — `start` / `progress` (every 3 phases) / `iteration` / `verdict` / `abort` / `sos` events via `~/.aisb/bin/audit-notify.sh`
- ✅ **Discovery drift check** — on resumed runs, if `audits/.uiuxaudit/discovery/` > 1h old, re-verify inventory or abort with user-confirm
- ✅ **Self-telemetry** — `audits/.uiuxaudit/telemetry.json` emitted at completion (duration, tokens, phases, fixes, model, preamble_version)
- ✅ **Deprecation registry** — cross-references checked against `~/.claude/DEPRECATED.md`; stale refs flagged as findings
- ✅ **Rule-46 compliance** — NO `--quick`/`--streamlined`/`--lightweight` variants. Narrower scope uses `--focus <area>` flags with FULL phase depth. Orchestrator prompts containing rule-46 banned phrases are REFUSED.
- ✅ **Score normalization** — raw score divided by applicable-phase-max × 100 = /100 normalized score
- ✅ **preamble_version** — emitted as `"1.0"` in verdict.json for `/metaudit` compliance scan

### Audit-Specific Critical Addendum — Non-UI ABORT Gate

```
Phase 0 step 0.5: detect UI surface
1. Check for Next.js/React/Vue/Svelte/Astro in package.json
2. Check for .tsx/.jsx/.vue/.svelte files
3. Check for HTML entry + CSS
4. If none detected → ABORT with:
   "No visual UI detected in this project.
    Suggested alternatives:
      /dxaudit  — for CLI UX and developer-facing interfaces
      /copyaudit — for text-only interfaces (docs, emails, terminal)
    Do NOT run /uiuxaudit on backend/library/CLI projects — produces hallucinated findings."
```

Phase bloat (25 phases) documented in `QUALITY-ARSENAL.md` — visual design has more facets than data integrity, hence higher count. Not a bug, by design.

### Scoring addenda

Normalized score = (raw_score / applicable_raw_max) × 100.
Applicable max excludes phases marked N/A for project type (see preamble §5).
`verdict.json.preamble_version = "1.0"` is MANDATORY. Missing field = /metaudit flags as non-compliant.

### /metaudit Compliance Badge

Run `/metaudit --focus arsenal` to verify this audit against the 11-point preamble checklist. Target score: 11/11.

> *Final gap-closure layer. Every finding from the prior /flowaudit-of-all-audits analysis (uiuxaudit-specific section) is now explicitly resolved below.*

```

### Gap closures (pre-100 findings → now resolved)

**Gap 1: Non-UI ABORT gate → RESOLVED in Phase 0 step 0.5**
```
Phase 0 step 0.5 (MANDATORY before any visual audit):
  1. Detect UI framework: Next.js/React/Vue/Svelte/Astro/Remix/SolidJS in package.json
  2. Detect UI files: glob for *.tsx, *.jsx, *.vue, *.svelte, *.astro (>= 3 matches)
  3. Detect HTML entry: index.html or app/layout.tsx equivalent
  4. Detect CSS: .css/.scss/.pcss/.module.css files OR Tailwind config
  5. If NONE detected → ABORT:
     "No visual UI detected. Route to:
        /dxaudit  — CLI UX, dev-facing interfaces
        /copyaudit — text-only (docs, emails, terminal output)
      /uiuxaudit produces hallucinated findings on non-UI projects."
```

**Gap 2: Phase bloat (25) rationale → RESOLVED**
Visual design has 25 orthogonal dimensions (colors, typography, coherence, spacing, hierarchy, motion, states, responsive, dark mode, brand, Gestalt, touch targets, a11y, smells, etc.). Other audits have fewer because fewer dimensions. Not a bug — documented in `QUALITY-ARSENAL-PREAMBLE.md §8`.

**Gap 3: Skill handoff contracts → RESOLVED**
When /uiuxaudit invokes other skills in Phase 23 fix execution:
- `Skill("shadcn-ui")` contract: pass `{component: name, issue: description, current_path: path}`, expect fix diff
- `Skill("taste-skill")` contract: pass `{scope: page, violations: [...]}`, expect rewrite
- `Skill("design-system")` contract: pass `{tokens_to_extract: [...]}`, expect tokens.css diff
- `Skill("web-design-guidelines")` contract: pass `{component: code}`, expect violations[]
- `Skill("frontend-design")` contract: pass `{page: url}`, expect pattern recommendations
All handoffs must succeed or fix is reverted.

**Gap 4: Scope detection for partial audits → RESOLVED**
`--focus colors|coherence|typography|a11y|smells` narrow to specific phases with FULL depth (no degradation). Rule 46 compliant.

### Final score calculation

```
score_100 = (raw_score / applicable_raw_max) × 100
           = fully-compliant audit at 100 achievable when:
             - All findings resolved OR
             - Remaining findings are declared NEEDS_REVIEW with user-confirm

After v1.2 compliance round:
  - All shared blindspots (S1-S10): closed
  - Audit-specific pre-100 gaps: closed explicitly above
  - verdict.json.preamble_version = "1.0" verification
  - /metaudit --focus arsenal target: 11/11 preamble points × 14 audits = 154/154
```

### Verification command

```bash
# Run /metaudit to verify this audit's 100/100 claim:
/metaudit --focus arsenal --scope="uiuxaudit only"
# Expected result:
#   preamble_compliance_score: 11/11 (full)
#   audit_specific_compliance: 100/100
#   overall: 100/100
```

---

## MANDATORY BEFORE/AFTER VERIFICATION (v1.1)

**Read `~/.claude/commands/AUDIT-VERIFICATION-CONTRACT.md` before ANY fix execution.**

Every fix MUST follow the "Do No Harm" protocol:

1. **PRE-FIX BASELINE** — grep all references, capture functional state, save to `.{audit}/baseline/`.
2. **APPLY FIX** — normal execution.
3. **POST-FIX CHECK** — repeat every baseline check. If any PASSED→FAILED transition occurs, revert immediately.
4. **BREAKAGE SCAN** — grep for old paths across ecosystem, must return 0 non-ephemeral hits.
5. **BEFORE/AFTER MATRIX** — produce `.{audit}/before-after.md` with functional status table per affected item.

**An audit that breaks 1 working thing is WORSE than no audit.** Do NOT claim "done" without `before-after.md` showing zero regressions.
