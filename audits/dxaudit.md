description: >
  Forensic developer experience audit v1 (Gestalt-Popper). 21-phase deep analysis of every
  DX surface: README quality (can a new dev start in <10min), Setup complexity (steps to run
  locally), Error message quality (actionable vs cryptic — owns HELPFULNESS; /copyaudit owns
  CLARITY; /debugaudit owns ACCURACY), TypeScript strictness, Code documentation (JSDoc on
  public APIs), Testing infrastructure, CI/CD pipeline quality, PR template/process,
  Dependency management, Monorepo structure, Dev tooling (linting, formatting, pre-commit hooks),
  Environment parity (dev/staging/prod), Debug tooling, Migration guides, Changelog maintenance,
  Contribution guide, plus verdict, fix plan, fix execution, re-audit, and integration smoke gate.
  Score /320. Preamble v1.0 compliant. Primary audit for CLI/library projects (replaces
  /uiuxaudit + /flowaudit + /motionaudit which ABORT on non-UI). Audit -> Plan -> Fix -> Re-audit.
  Use when user says "/dxaudit", "dx audit", "developer experience", "onboarding audit",
  "can a new dev start", "setup complexity", "contribution guide check".

<!-- AUDIT-META-V2-INJECTED -->

> ## ⚠️ MANDATORY FIRST STEP — READ THE V2 META-PROTOCOL
>
> **Before doing ANYTHING else**, Read `~/.claude/audit-meta-protocol-v2.md`.
>
> That file overrides any conflicting guidance below for these five aspects:
> 1. Required CLI inputs (`--user-need`, `--hinge` are MANDATORY since 2026-05-08)
> 2. Required JSON output schema (v2: score + confidence + falsifiable_tests + user_need_match + hinge_findings)
> 3. Popper falsification — every PASS must cite ≥3 concrete commands run with actual output
> 4. Confidence calibration — `high` requires direct verification of every claim
> 5. Banned shortcut phrases — `looks correct`, `should be fine`, `appears to work` = automatic FAIL
>
> If `--user-need` or `--hinge` is missing from your invocation, refuse to run and write
> `{"score":0,"confidence":"low","error":"missing v2 inputs","request_redispatch":true}`.
>
> The legacy v1 schema (`{"score":100,"skill_used":"<name>"}`) is accepted with a warning until 2026-06-01,
> then removed. Always emit v2 going forward.
>
> Model context: this audit runs on Opus 4.7 with max effort. There is no time pressure.
> Run every test you claim to have run. Cite verbatim outputs. No exceptions.

# /dxaudit v1 — Forensic Developer Experience Audit (Gestalt-Popper)

> *"The other audits ask 'does it work?' I ask 'can a new developer SHIP within a day?'"*

---

## DOCTRINE

You are not a project manager. You are a **developer experience forensic pathologist**. The codebase is your patient — possibly impossible to set up locally, definitely missing documentation, pretending to be developer-friendly because someone wrote "just run npm install" in the README. Your job is to find every friction point, every missing guide, every cryptic error that makes a new developer want to quit.

**The 5 Laws of DX Forensics (Gestalt-Popper Synthesis):**
1. **If it builds, it's still hostile.** A project that compiles doesn't mean a developer can understand it, contribute to it, or debug it. DX bugs are invisible walls — the victims are developers who wasted 3 hours setting up what should have taken 10 minutes.
2. **The README lies (Popper).** "Just clone and run" never works. FALSIFY every setup instruction by following them LITERALLY on a fresh environment. If any step fails, is unclear, or is missing, the README is a lie.
3. **Every undocumented decision is tribal knowledge.** That env variable nobody explained. That build step that "everyone knows." That deployment process in someone's head. Each is bus-factor-1 knowledge that will be lost.
4. **Clarity before measuring (Gestalt).** Before running any tool, UNDERSTAND the project's intent. Read CLAUDE.md, VISION.md, architecture docs. Identify the **HINGE EXPERIENCE** — the first 30 minutes of a new developer. THIS experience gets every phase at 10x depth.
5. **"Ask in Slack" is not documentation (Popper).** If the answer lives in someone's head or a chat history, it's not documented. FALSIFY every "it's documented" claim by finding it in the repo.

**Gestalt Hinge Experience:** Before Phase 1, identify THE critical developer journey — from git clone to first successful contribution. THIS journey gets every phase at maximum depth.

**Popper DX Falsification Categories:**
- **README vs REALITY** — Docs say "5 minutes," actual setup takes 2 hours
- **LOCAL vs CI** — Works in CI, fails locally (or vice versa)
- **FIRST vs REPEAT** — Easy to run again, impossible to set up the first time
- **HAPPY vs ERROR** — No errors in docs, but 50 undocumented failure modes
- **EXPERT vs NEWCOMER** — Original dev ships fast, new dev is lost for days

## PHASE 0: RECONNAISSANCE

> *"Know the project before judging its developer experience."*

```
1. PROJECT DISCOVERY
   -> Read CLAUDE.md, README, package.json/pyproject.toml
   -> Identify: stack, language, framework, package manager
   -> Find: required services (database, cache, queues)
   -> Note: project age, contributor count, commit frequency

2. TOOLCHAIN INVENTORY
   -> Build tool (Vite, Webpack, Turbopack, esbuild)
   -> Test runner (Jest, Vitest, Playwright, Cypress)
   -> Linter (ESLint, Biome, Ruff)
   -> Formatter (Prettier, Biome, Black)
   -> Type checker (TypeScript, mypy, Pyright)
   -> Pre-commit hooks (Husky, lint-staged, pre-commit)
   -> CI/CD (GitHub Actions, Vercel, Railway)

3. DEVELOPER POPULATION
   -> How many active contributors?
   -> New contributor in last 90 days?
   -> Bus factor (how many devs can the project lose?)
```

---

## PHASE 1: README QUALITY (PART OF THE HINGE)

> *"The README is the front door. If it's locked, nobody enters."*

```
1. THE 10-MINUTE TEST
   -> Can a developer go from zero to running app in < 10 minutes?
   -> Timer starts at git clone, ends at working local environment
   -> Every missing step is a failure
   -> Every "you should already have X installed" is a failure

2. REQUIRED SECTIONS
   -> Project description (what is this, in one paragraph)
   -> Prerequisites (OS, runtime versions, required services)
   -> Installation (step-by-step, copy-pasteable commands)
   -> Running locally (exact command to start)
   -> Environment variables (every var, what it does, example value)
   -> Architecture overview (how the pieces fit together)
   -> Common issues / troubleshooting

3. README QUALITY
   -> Commands are copy-pasteable (not pseudocode)
   -> No assumed knowledge ("you know how to...")
   -> Links to deeper docs where appropriate
   -> Up to date (matches current project state)
   -> No broken links

4. ANTI-PATTERNS
   -> "TODO: add documentation"
   -> Empty sections
   -> Instructions for a different version of the project
   -> "See wiki" (wiki is empty or outdated)
   -> README longer than 500 lines (should link to /docs)

FALSIFY: Follow the README literally. New terminal. Fresh clone. Every step. If you get stuck, the README failed.
```

---

## PHASE 2: SETUP COMPLEXITY (PART OF THE HINGE)

> *"If setting up requires a PhD in DevOps, you've lost 90% of potential contributors."*

```
1. STEP COUNT
   -> Count distinct manual steps from clone to running
   -> Target: < 5 steps (clone, install, env, run)
   -> Each additional step is friction
   -> Automation potential for manual steps

2. DEPENDENCY SETUP
   -> How many external services needed? (DB, Redis, Stripe, etc.)
   -> Docker Compose for local services? (should be)
   -> Cloud service accounts needed for local dev?
   -> Mock/stub alternatives for external services?

3. ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
   -> .env.example or .env.template exists
   -> Every variable documented (purpose, format, where to get it)
   -> Sensible defaults for local development
   -> No required secrets for basic local dev

4. PLATFORM COMPATIBILITY
   -> Works on macOS, Linux, Windows (or documented exceptions)
   -> Shell scripts have shebangs and are POSIX-compatible
   -> Path separators handled (no hardcoded / or \\)
   -> Works with common Node/Python/etc. version managers

5. AUTOMATION
   -> One-command setup script? (make setup, ./setup.sh)
   -> Dev containers / devcontainer.json?
   -> Codespaces / Gitpod support?
   -> Nix/Flake for reproducible environments?

FALSIFY: Time the setup. If it takes > 15 minutes for an experienced dev, it's too complex.
```

---

## PHASE 3: ERROR MESSAGE QUALITY

> *"'Error: ENOENT' tells the developer nothing. 'File not found: .env — copy .env.example to .env' tells them everything."*

```
1. BUILD ERROR MESSAGES
   -> Build failures give actionable guidance
   -> Missing dependencies identified by name
   -> Version conflicts explained (not just stack trace)
   -> Common errors have documented solutions

2. RUNTIME ERROR MESSAGES
   -> Missing env vars: name the var and where to get it
   -> Connection failures: name the service and how to start it
   -> Auth errors: explain what credentials are needed
   -> Import errors: explain what to install

3. DEVELOPMENT-MODE ERRORS
   -> Hot reload failures explained
   -> Type errors readable (not 50-line generics explosion)
   -> Test failures point to the failing assertion
   -> Lint errors explain the rule and fix

4. ERROR DOCUMENTATION
   -> Common errors listed in README or TROUBLESHOOTING.md
   -> Error codes linkable to documentation
   -> Stack Overflow / Discord / GitHub Issues for help
```

---

## PHASE 4: TYPESCRIPT STRICTNESS

```
1. TSCONFIG AUDIT
   -> strict: true (or equivalent individual flags)
   -> noImplicitAny: true
   -> strictNullChecks: true
   -> noUncheckedIndexedAccess: true (ideal)
   -> exactOptionalPropertyTypes: true (ideal)

2. TYPE SAFETY IN PRACTICE
   -> No widespread use of 'any' (count instances)
   -> No @ts-ignore without explanatory comment
   -> Generics used properly (not just <any>)
   -> Utility types used (Partial, Pick, Omit, etc.)

3. TYPE COVERAGE
   -> All public APIs typed (no implicit returns)
   -> Function parameters typed (no reliance on inference alone)
   -> Return types explicit on exported functions
   -> Props interfaces defined for components

4. NON-TYPESCRIPT PROJECTS
   -> If Python: mypy/Pyright configured with strict mode
   -> If Go: staticcheck/golangci-lint configured
   -> If Rust: clippy warnings addressed
   -> JSDoc type annotations if JavaScript
```

---

## PHASE 5: CODE DOCUMENTATION

```
1. PUBLIC API DOCUMENTATION
   -> Exported functions have JSDoc/docstrings
   -> Parameters documented with types and descriptions
   -> Return values documented
   -> Exceptions/errors documented
   -> Usage examples in complex functions

2. ARCHITECTURE DOCUMENTATION
   -> High-level architecture diagram (text or image)
   -> Data flow documentation
   -> Key design decisions documented (ADRs)
   -> Domain glossary (project-specific terms defined)

3. INLINE DOCUMENTATION
   -> Complex algorithms have explanatory comments
   -> Business logic has "why" comments (not "what" comments)
   -> Workarounds have links to issues/tickets
   -> TODO comments have tracking issues

4. DOCUMENTATION FRESHNESS
   -> Docs match current code behavior
   -> No references to deleted functions/files

   -> Integration tests present
   -> E2E tests present (for user-facing features)
   -> Type tests (for library projects)

4. TEST QUALITY
   -> Tests are deterministic (no flaky tests)
   -> Tests are fast (full suite < 5 minutes)
   -> Tests are independent (order doesn't matter)
   -> Test data is isolated (no shared mutable state)
   -> Mocks/stubs for external services

5. TEST DX
   -> Watch mode available
   -> Single test/file runnable
   -> Debug configuration for tests (breakpoints work)
   -> Test failure messages clear and actionable
```

1. CI PIPELINE
   -> All PRs run CI (no bypassing)
   -> CI includes: lint, type check, test, build
   -> CI time < 10 minutes (fast feedback)
   -> CI failures are actionable (not "exit code 1" with no context)

2. CD PIPELINE
   -> Deployment automated (merge to main = deploy)
   -> Staging environment for pre-production testing
   -> Rollback mechanism available
   -> Deploy notifications (Slack, Discord, etc.)

3. CI RELIABILITY
   -> No flaky CI (same commit, same result)
   -> CI matches local environment (no "works locally, fails in CI")
   -> Dependency caching for speed
   -> Parallel jobs where possible

4. BRANCH PROTECTION
   -> Main branch protected
   -> Required CI checks before merge

  70-79:  B — Adequate. Some setup pain, decent docs, most tooling in place.
  60-69:  C — Frustrating. New dev needs help to set up, gaps in docs.
  50-59:  D — Hostile. Multiple hours to set up, poor error messages, missing docs.
  <50:    F — Abandoned. New dev cannot contribute without personal guidance.

```
Sort: CRITICAL -> HIGH -> MEDIUM -> LOW
Priority: setup > README > error messages > testing > tooling > docs
Generate fix tasks with file specificity
Save to audits/.dxaudit/fix-plan.json + fix-plan.md
```

---

## PHASE 19: FIX EXECUTION (automatic)

```
Sequential per fix group.

─── SAFETY GATE: DO NO HARM (MANDATORY before EVERY fix) ──────────────

The audit MUST NOT introduce new bugs. A fix that breaks the code is worse than
the original finding. Every fix goes through this gate BEFORE commit.

PRE-FIX ANALYSIS (before writing ANY code):
  a. Read the ENTIRE target file (not just the target line)
  b. SCOPE COLLISION CHECK — if adding/renaming a variable or import:
     → Grep the ENTIRE file for that name (all occurrences)
     → Check: is this name already used as a local, parameter, or reassigned?
     → Check: does this name get shadowed later in the same scope?
     → If collision found → use a different name or fully-qualified reference
  c. IMPORT SHADOW CHECK — if adding `from X import Y` inside a function:
     → This makes Y a LOCAL variable for the ENTIRE function scope
     → If Y is also used from module-level import → UnboundLocalError
     → Fix: use the module-level import, don't re-import locally
  d. CROSS-REFERENCE CHECK — if modifying a function signature, class, or export:
     → Grep the ENTIRE project for all callers/importers of that symbol
     → Verify every caller still works with the new signature
     → If callers exist outside the file → update them ALL or don't change

POST-FIX VERIFICATION (after writing code, BEFORE commit):
  a. SYNTAX CHECK:
     → Python: `python -c "import ast; ast.parse(open('FILE').read())"`
     → JS/TS: `npx tsc --noEmit` or `node -c FILE`
  b. IMPORT CHECK — verify the module actually loads without error:
     → Python: `python -c "import MODULE"` (catches UnboundLocalError, NameError, etc.)
     → JS: `node -e "require('./FILE')"`
  c. RUNTIME SMOKE TEST — if the project has a service (bot, server, API):
     → Start it briefly and verify it doesn't crash on init
     → Python: `timeout 10 python main.py` or systemctl restart + is-active check
     → Node: `timeout 10 node server.js` or `npm run build`
     → If service crashes → git revert HEAD → mark NEEDS_REVIEW
  d. TEST SUITE — if tests exist:
     → Run the relevant test file(s): `pytest FILE -x` / `vitest run FILE`
     → If tests fail → git revert HEAD → investigate

IF ANY POST-FIX CHECK FAILS:
  → `git revert HEAD` immediately
  → Log the failure in .audit/fix-log.md with exact error
  → Mark as NEEDS_REVIEW (never retry same approach blindly)
  → Try alternative approach OR skip this fix

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

FOR EACH FIX TASK (in priority order):
  a. Read the ENTIRE target file (full context)
  b. Run PRE-FIX ANALYSIS (scope collision, import shadow, cross-reference)
  c. Apply fix (create doc, add script, configure tool)
  d. Run POST-FIX VERIFICATION (syntax, import, smoke test, tests)
  e. If all green → commit: dx(dxaudit): FIX-XXX description
  f. If any red → revert → log → mark NEEDS_REVIEW
  g. Verify: no regression in existing developer workflows
  h. If fix changes build process -> mark NEEDS_REVIEW (team coordination)
```

---

## PHASE 20: RE-AUDIT (automatic)

```
1. SERVICE HEALTH GATE (mandatory):
   → If project has systemd service: restart it, wait 10s, check is-active + logs for errors
   → If project has build step: full build must pass
   → If project has tests: full test suite must pass
   → If ANY fails: identify which fix broke it, revert

2. Re-run all FAILING phases. Compare before/after.
3. Loop until score >= 80 or remaining items are NEEDS_REVIEW.

## CROSS-COMMAND BRIDGE

```
/dxaudit finds code quality issues -> references /codeaudit findings
/dxaudit finds test issues -> references testing in /codeaudit
/dxaudit finds build issues -> references /perfaudit findings
/dxaudit finds security in setup -> references /secaudit findings

THE QUALITY ARSENAL:
  /codeaudit    -> Is the code SOLID?           (preventive)
  /flowaudit    -> Does the experience WORK?    (preventive)
  /uiuxaudit    -> Is the interface BEAUTIFUL?  (preventive)
  /debugaudit   -> What is BROKEN right now?    (detective)
  /featureaudit -> Is the product COMPLETE?     (strategic)
  /perfaudit    -> Is it FAST enough?           (detective)
  /secaudit     -> Is it SECURE?                (detective)
  /a11yaudit    -> Can EVERYONE use it?         (inclusive)
  /seoaudit     -> Can search engines FIND it?  (growth)

## LAWS

1. **Time-to-first-contribution is your DX metric.** If it's > 1 day, your DX is broken.
2. **The README is a contract.** If it says "easy setup," setup must actually be easy.
3. **Automation beats documentation.** A setup script is worth 1000 words of instructions.
4. **Error messages are UI for developers (Popper).** "ENOENT" is not a UI. "Missing .env file — run cp .env.example .env" is.
5. **TypeScript strict mode is free documentation.** Types tell the next developer what you meant.
6. **Tests are trust.** Without tests, every change is a gamble. With tests, every change is safe.
7. **CI is the immune system.** If it's slow or flaky, the team will bypass it. Keep it fast and reliable.

## COMPLIANCE & CRITICAL ADDENDA (v1.1 — 2026-04-14T10:35:36Z)

### Quality Arsenal Preamble Compliance

This audit implements contracts defined in `~/.claude/commands/QUALITY-ARSENAL-PREAMBLE.md` v1.0:

- ✅ **Gestalt-Popper doctrine** — hinge point, falsification, evidence chain, adversarial thinking
- ✅ **Concurrency lock** — `audits/.dxaudit/.lock` with 4h stale timeout, released on EXIT trap
- ✅ **5-iteration cap** — fix-and-reaudit loop bounded at 5 iterations (rule 43 step 8b alignment). On cap: NEEDS_REVIEW + Telegram SOS. No silent infinite loops.
- ✅ **Scoped invocation flags** — `--url=`, `--files=`, `--scope=`, `--ticket=`, `--no-fix`, `--focus=`
- ✅ **Non-UI context gate** — Non-UI contexts: /dxaudit is PRIMARY audit for CLI tools and libraries. Full phases run.
- ✅ **Output contract verification** — emits `audits/.dxaudit/verdict.json`, `verdict.md`, `fix-plan.json`, `fix-plan.md`, `iterations.md`, `progress.json`, `telemetry.json`, `fix-log.md`. Output gate runs at end; missing/malformed files = audit did NOT succeed.
- ✅ **Telegram progress notifications** — `start` / `progress` (every 3 phases) / `iteration` / `verdict` / `abort` / `sos` events via `~/.aisb/bin/audit-notify.sh`
- ✅ **Discovery drift check** — on resumed runs, if `audits/.dxaudit/discovery/` > 1h old, re-verify inventory or abort with user-confirm
- ✅ **Self-telemetry** — `audits/.dxaudit/telemetry.json` emitted at completion (duration, tokens, phases, fixes, model, preamble_version)
- ✅ **Deprecation registry** — cross-references checked against `~/.claude/DEPRECATED.md`; stale refs flagged as findings
- ✅ **Rule-46 compliance** — NO `--quick`/`--streamlined`/`--lightweight` variants. Narrower scope uses `--focus <area>` flags with FULL phase depth. Orchestrator prompts containing rule-46 banned phrases are REFUSED.
- ✅ **Score normalization** — raw score divided by applicable-phase-max × 100 = /100 normalized score
- ✅ **preamble_version** — emitted as `"1.0"` in verdict.json for `/metaudit` compliance scan

### Audit-Specific Critical Addendum — External Setup-Time Runner + README Rigor

**Setup-time measurement (requires external runner):**
- Cannot run in-Claude-Code-session (needs clean VM/container)
- Document runner command in verdict.md:
  ```
  docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/app -w /app node:20 bash -c "
    time (npm install 2>&1 | tee /tmp/install.log)
    time (npm run dev 2>&1 | grep -q -E \"ready|listening\" || false)
  "
  ```
- Emit manual verification prompt in verdict.json: `manual_verification_required: ["setup_time"]`
- /dxaudit score includes setup-time dimension IF the user supplies external benchmark, else that phase is N/A

**README quality scoring (make objective):**
- 20 rubric items: project name, one-line description, install command, run command, first-demo command, env vars documented, contributing section, license, troubleshooting section, architecture diagram, API ref link, deployment instructions, test command, formatting section, version requirements, OS compatibility, screenshots, changelog link, code-of-conduct, security policy
- Score = items present / 20 × phase max

### Scoring addenda

Normalized score = (raw_score / applicable_raw_max) × 100.
Applicable max excludes phases marked N/A for project type (see preamble §5).
`verdict.json.preamble_version = "1.0"` is MANDATORY. Missing field = /metaudit flags as non-compliant.

### /metaudit Compliance Badge

Run `/metaudit --focus arsenal` to verify this audit against the 11-point preamble checklist. Target score: 11/11.

### Compliance Matrix (machine-verifiable by /metaudit)

```json

}
```

### Gap closures (pre-100 findings → now resolved)

**Gap 1: External setup-time runner → RESOLVED**
```
Phase 8 (setup-time measurement) requires external runner.

Runner command (documented in verdict.md for reproducibility):
  docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/app -w /app node:20-alpine bash -c "
    apk add --no-cache bash git
    START=\$(date +%s)
    npm install --no-audit 2>&1 | tee /tmp/install.log
    INSTALL_END=\$(date +%s)
    echo \"INSTALL_TIME=\$((INSTALL_END - START))\" > /tmp/metrics
    timeout 30 npm run dev 2>&1 | tee /tmp/dev.log &
    DEV_PID=\$!
    while ! grep -qE \"ready|listening|started\" /tmp/dev.log; do
      sleep 1
      if ! kill -0 \$DEV_PID 2>/dev/null; then
        echo \"DEV_FAILED\" >> /tmp/metrics; exit 1
      fi
    done
    READY=\$(date +%s)
    echo \"READY_TIME=\$((READY - START))\" >> /tmp/metrics
    cat /tmp/metrics
  "

Thresholds (in README-rubric dimension):
  - Ready time < 60s: full credit
  - 60-120s: 50% credit
  - > 120s: 0 credit (setup too slow for good DX)

If runner unavailable (no Docker): emit manual_verification_required in verdict.json.
```

**Gap 2: 20-item README rubric → RESOLVED**
```
1.  Project name + one-line description (first 3 lines)
2.  Badge row (build, version, license, etc.) optional but counted if present
3.  Install command (npm/pnpm/yarn/bun install)
4.  Quick-start / run command
5.  First-demo / hello-world example
6.  Environment variables documented (.env.example or table)
7.  Architecture diagram OR arch section
8.  API reference link (or inline for small projects)
9.  Deployment instructions (Vercel/Fly/etc.)
10. Test command (npm test / pnpm test / etc.)
11. Contributing section / CONTRIBUTING.md reference
12. License section / LICENSE file
13. Troubleshooting / FAQ section
14. Changelog link / CHANGELOG.md
15. Security policy / SECURITY.md / email
16. Code of conduct / CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
17. Version requirements (Node version, Python version, etc.)
18. OS compatibility note (Linux/Mac/Windows)
19. Screenshots / demo video / GIF
20. Formatting / style commands (lint, format)
Score: items_present / 20 × phase_max
```

**Gap 3: Non-UI contexts → RESOLVED via preamble §5:**
/dxaudit is PRIMARY audit for CLI tools + libraries. Phase weights adjust: README + error messages + install speed weighted higher for non-UI projects.

### Final score calculation

```
score_100 = (raw_score / applicable_raw_max) × 100
           = fully-compliant audit at 100 achievable when:
             - All findings resolved OR
             - Remaining findings are declared NEEDS_REVIEW with user-confirm

After v1.2 compliance round:
  - All shared blindspots (S1-S10): closed
  - Audit-specific pre-100 gaps: closed explicitly above
  - verdict.json.preamble_version = "1.0" verification
  - /metaudit --focus arsenal target: 11/11 preamble points × 14 audits = 154/154
```

### Verification command

```bash
# Run /metaudit to verify this audit's 100/100 claim:
/metaudit --focus arsenal --scope="dxaudit only"
# Expected result:
#   preamble_compliance_score: 11/11 (full)
#   audit_specific_compliance: 100/100
#   overall: 100/100
```

## MANDATORY BEFORE/AFTER VERIFICATION (v1.1)

**Read `~/.claude/commands/AUDIT-VERIFICATION-CONTRACT.md` before ANY fix execution.**

Every fix MUST follow the "Do No Harm" protocol:

1. **PRE-FIX BASELINE** — grep all references, capture functional state, save to `.{audit}/baseline/`.
2. **APPLY FIX** — normal execution.
3. **POST-FIX CHECK** — repeat every baseline check. If any PASSED→FAILED transition occurs, revert immediately.
4. **BREAKAGE SCAN** — grep for old paths across ecosystem, must return 0 non-ephemeral hits.
5. **BEFORE/AFTER MATRIX** — produce `.{audit}/before-after.md` with functional status table per affected item.

**An audit that breaks 1 working thing is WORSE than no audit.** Do NOT claim "done" without `before-after.md` showing zero regressions.
